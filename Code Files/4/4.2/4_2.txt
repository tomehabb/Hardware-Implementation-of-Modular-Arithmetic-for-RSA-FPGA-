Recovered Private Keys
The attack successfully identified 11 distinct private keys that map the plaintext 1000 to the ciphertext 12486. The keys are spaced at regular intervals (every 0x1900 or 6400 values):

0x0003

0x1903

0x3203

0x4B03

0x6403

0x7D03

0x9603

0xAF03

0xC803

0xE103

0xFA03

Timing Analysis
With your measured speed of ~0.59 seconds per key, the full brute-force scan of the 16-bit keyspace (65,536 values) takes approximately 6.5 seconds to complete. This indicates a very efficient hardware implementation, significantly faster than the single worst-case timing would suggest.
