The Finite State Machine (FSM) consists of 10 distinct states that orchestrate a modular exponentiation process, cycling through initialization, squaring, and conditional multiplication phases. Transitions between these states are logic-driven, relying on signals such as `x_i` to determine whether to multiply, `mult_done` to confirm calculation completion, and `finished` to terminate the loop. The flow progresses from initialization into a main loop that alternates between squaring and multiplication operations until the entire computation is finalized in the `Done_st` state.
